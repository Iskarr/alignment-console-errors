# alignment-console-errors
This is a project to help people solve common console errors.

## Getting Started with the Project
You can get the project files from GitHub in two ways: either by cloning the repository or by downloading a ZIP file.

## Option 1: Clone the Repository
This is the recommended method if you're comfortable with Git.

Open your terminal or Git Bash.

Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL:

git clone https://github.com/Iskarr/alignment-console-errors.git

This will create a new folder named alignment-console-errors with all the project files inside.

## Option 2: Download the ZIP File
This is a great option if you don't have Git set up.

Go to the GitHub repository page: https://github.com/Iskarr/alignment-console-errors.

Click the green < > Code button.

From the dropdown menu, click "Download ZIP".

Once the file is downloaded, unzip it on your computer.

## Setting Up and Solving the Bugs
Open in Visual Studio Code: Navigate to the unzipped or cloned folder and open it in Visual Studio Code.

Launch with Live Server: In VS Code, find the index.html file, right-click on it, and select "Open with Live Server". This will open the project in your web browser. Make sure you have the Live Server extension installed.

Open the Console: In your web browser, open the developer tools and navigate to the Console tab. You'll see a list of error messages.

Solve the Errors: Go back to VS Code and open the bugs.js file. Your task is to go through the file and fix the errors.

Check Your Progress: As you fix an error and save the bugs.js file, Live Server will automatically reload the page in your browser. Watch the console to see the errors disappear!
